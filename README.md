# World_Weather_Analysis

Data Bootcamp Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to retrieve information by using APIs (application programming interface) to visualize weather data from coordinates and create a vacation itinerary according to some criteria. The used coordinates were random generated (random library), the weather information was retrieved from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/, and the mapping was done using Google Maps APIs.

## Resoruces
**For this analysis, the following resuorces were used**:
- Data Sources: Open Weather Map, Google Maps
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 4.8
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Request and gmaps.

## Process

**Step 1:**

- To start the project, first we create 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes using the function random (inlcuded in NumPy) with the following code:

- Then we pair each latitude and longitude created (by index) to search the nearest city and storage that city in a new list by ussing the append function:
